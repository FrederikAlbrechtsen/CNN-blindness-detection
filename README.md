# Blindness detection with Artificial Intelligence
A CNN classification model that achieves 75% accuracy on APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection. The data used are from https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection. It contrains large images in high-resolution. Clinicians had rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image between 0 and 4, according to the following scale:
0. No DR
1. Mild
2. Moderate
3. Severe
4. Proliferative DR
Images are decreased to 50x50 in size, since using the large high-resolution images would have slowed down the training significant.
